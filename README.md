# Lab Instructions
You are given a `String` object where your task is to simply reverse the string using a recursive solution.
``` java
// Input:
"Hello World"

// Output:
"dlroW olleH"
```



## Testing
Your own testing
You can conduct your own testing and debugging as you please by inserting System.out.print(). However, we do have our own set of test cases.

### Running our Tests
The lab comes with a couple of pre-built tests cases that will verify the correct functionality of your implementation. Go over to the check mark on the left hand side of the IDE and hit Run tests. All green means you have passed the test cases. Red will mean you failed a test case, or an error occured. Read the stack trace to investigate why you are not passing the test cases.
